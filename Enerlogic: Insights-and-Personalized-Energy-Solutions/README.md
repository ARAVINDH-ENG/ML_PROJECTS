# EnerLogic: Insights and Personalized Energy Solutions

## Overview
EnerLogic is a predictive analytics project designed to analyze and improve customer satisfaction within the energy sector. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project evaluates customer satisfaction scores and identifies factors that influence the user experience in energy services. The insights generated by EnerLogic are intended to guide targeted service improvements and enhance customer engagement.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer satisfaction data to identify trends and patterns.
- Develop a predictive model using Ridge Regression to forecast satisfaction scores.
- Provide actionable insights for improving energy service delivery based on customer feedback data.


## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer feedback records, with features such as satisfaction scores, service parameters, demographics, and feedback comments. The dataset structure:

## Requirements
To replicate the project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Ingests customer feedback data, cleans, and preprocesses it for analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements Ridge Regression for predicting customer satisfaction scores with an accuracy rate of 85%.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight key factors affecting customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Model**: Ridge Regression
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## Usage
-1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARAVINDH-ENG/ML_PROJECTS/tree/main/Enerlogic%3A%20Insights-and-Personalized-Energy-Solutions
```

## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled by removing rows with null entries or by imputing values where necessary.
- **Feature Selection**: Only the most relevant features, such as `Monthly Energy Consumption`, `Satisfaction Score`, and `Customer Lifetime Value`, were selected based on correlation analysis.
- **Scaling**: Features such as energy usage and income were scaled to normalize the data for more consistent model performance.

## Model Training
The project employed the **Ridge Regression** algorithm to predict customer satisfaction levels.
- **Hyperparameters**: Optimal hyperparameters were identified through grid search, improving the model’s predictive accuracy.
- **Training Process**: The model was trained on 80% of the data, with 20% held back for validation. The Ridge Regression model was chosen due to its ability to handle multicollinearity in the dataset, which was present in energy usage features.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model’s effectiveness, the following metrics were used:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Evaluates the average prediction error in absolute terms.
- **R-Squared**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in customer satisfaction.
- **Visualizations**: Model performance metrics were visualized using bar charts and line plots for accuracy, MAE, and R-squared scores.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **85%** in predicting customer satisfaction based on the selected features. Key findings include:
- Higher `Customer Lifetime Value` and lower `Monthly Energy Consumption` were correlated with higher satisfaction scores.
- The use of renewable energy sources was also positively associated with customer satisfaction.
